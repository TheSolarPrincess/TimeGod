Once, a certain employer published a game design position on the site hh.ru. They pretended to be [Geomax Games](https://geomaxgg.com/).

As a test task, they asked me to present a concept for my own game, that I will be employed to develop. Once I did so, they "approved" my concept and asked me to write a complete design document for the game by their template.

I did so, I basically designed the entire game for them. Then they tried to get me to start working on the game for them without making a contract. I got suspicious, and checked their claims. They turned out to be impostors -- not actually Geomax Games.

I basically did a giant piece of game design labor for them, gave them my ideas and my design, for free.

I don't know if they are going to make the game by my document eventually. If they do, I place this repository here, with my project, to prove that it was my idea and my design, and prehaps sue them for it.

If someone likes this concept and wants to create the game together with me -- send me a message.

The document was sent to them **27 July 2024**

The account they messaged me from was **Telegram: @wanteerw**

I hope those scammers get their comeuppance.
